Mapping of ESU Lokpilot5 for LS Models Vectron
The file is for mapping the ESU Lokpilot5 decoder to use in a LS Models Vectron. LS Models uses a special configuration to establish all light paterns.
You need to use a universal 21MTC decoder, NOT the MKL version.
In this mapping DC, AC, MM, MfX are switched off. Only DCC is activated. When you need it for MÃ¤rklin you can change the correct CV.
